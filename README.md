# spherical

This is an unbounded, but finite, world of dodecahedra.

WASD to move. QE for up/down
IJKL to turn. UO to do an aileron roll.

Spacebar to place a "breadcrumb".

You can view the spherical world [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/rtavenner/spherical/blob/master/index.html).


You are floating in a network of dodecahedral rooms, three around an edge. 
It seems to go on forever. But there are actually only 120 dodecahedra.
What's going on? 
Imagine you are stuck to the surface of a sphere with a dodecahedral pattern drawn on it. 
It would seem that you are stuck in an endless network of pentagons, three around a vertex. Yet there are only twelve pentagons.
This project is the same idea, but in one more dimension.

(Note: The program is written in Elm. The index.html file is the output of the Elm compiler.)
